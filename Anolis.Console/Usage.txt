-add          $targetFile, $saveTargetAs, $source,       $resourceName
-addskip      $targetFile, $saveTargetAs, $source,       $resourceName
-addoverwrite $targetFile, $saveTargetAs, $source,       $resourceName
-modify       $targetFile, $saveTargetAs, $source,       $resourceName
-extract      $targetFile, $destination,  $resourceName
-delete       $targetFile, $saveTargetAs, $resourceName
-script       $scriptFile,

You have my apologies for the complicated command-line syntax. This program
strives to be 100% compatible with ResHacker.exe so it inherits its convulted
command-line arguments.

Important Notice: NE, RES, and RC targets/sources are not currently supported!
Only individual PE files can be used as values for the $targetFile arguments.
The$source argument supports PE files in addition to file resources (e.g. *.ico
and *.bmp). Disregard any information printed below that makes reference to NE,
RES, or RC files. (That information exists purely for future reference).

-add, -addskip, -addoverwrite, -modify, -extract, -delete, -script
    Complicated. See below.
    
$targetFile
    Any resource$source supported by Anolis, such as PE, NE, RES, or RC files.

saveTargetAs
    The path to save the updated $targetFile to. You can use the same filename
    as $targetFile if you wish to overwrite it (NOT RECOMMENDED FOR SYSTEM
    FILES!)

source
    Any resource$source (PE, NE, RES, RC) or individual resource file (.ico,
    .bmp, etc) that contains the resource(s) to be added to $targetFile.
    
$resourceName
    Takes the forms "Type,Name,Lang", "Type,Name,", "Type,," or even ",,"
    
    Every resource that the operation (-add, -extract, etc) applies to will
    match the $resourceName value. See the examples below for more information.
    
    Type is a Resource Type Identifier. Either a String or Integer which
    corresponds to a ResourceType located in$source and $targetFile. Value is
    case-.insensitive. Note that the following Strings are reserved and map to
    the "RT_" types defined by Win32:
        CURSOR, BITMAP, ICON, MENU, DIALOG, STRINGTABLE, FONTDIRECTORY, FONT,
        ACCELERATOR, RCDATA, MESSAGETABLE, VERSION, DLGINCLUDE, PLUGANDPLAY,
        VXD, CURSORANIMATED, ICONANIMATED, HTML, MANIFEST
    
    Name is a Resource Name Identifier. Either a String or Integer which
    corresponds to a ResourceName located in$source and $targetFile.
    
    Lang is a Windows LCID.
    
-add
  Adds (or updates by overwriting) the resources in$source specified by
  $resourceName.
      
    If$source is an individual resource file (e.g. .ico or .bmp) then the 
    resource specified by $resourceName will be inserted or overwritten.
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,Name,Lang" the resource will be
        inserted or overwritten.
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,Name," all resources under Name
        regardless of language will be overwritten. No resources will be
        inserted.
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,," all resources under Type
        regardless of Name or Language will be overwritten. No resources will
        be inserted. (NOT RECOMMENDED!)
        
        If $resourceName is in the form ",," all resources in the $targetFile
        will be overwritten. This action is not recommended under any
        circumstances and you will smell like a big fat poo if you execute this
        command.
    
    If$source is a readable resource$source (e.g. PE, NE, RES, or RC) then
    every resource in the$source that matches $resourceName will be copied into
    $targetFile
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,Name,Lang" the single resource
        matching that name in$source will be copied to $targetFile.
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,Name," all resources in$source
        under the specified Type and Name will be copied to $targetFile (i.e.
        regardless of language)
        
        If $resourceName is in the form "Type,," all resources in$source
        under the specified Type will be copied to $targetFile (i.e. regardless
        of name and language)
        
        If $resourceName is in the form ",," all resources in$source will be
        copied to $targetFile.
        
        If a resource in$source already exists in $targetFile the operation
        will fail, see -addoverwrite or -addskip for more forgiving behaviour
        
-addskip
  Adds the resources in$source specified by $resourceName. Can only be used
  when $source is a readable resource$source (e.g. PE, NE, RES, or RC).
  
    This command Exhibits similar behaviour to -add except that if a resource
    in$source exists in $targetFile the resource will *not* be overwritten and
    the operation will continue (not fail)

-addoverwrite
  Adds (or updates by overwriting) the resources in$source specified by
  $resourceName. Can only be used when$source is a readable resource$source
  (e.g. PE, NE, RES, or RC).
  
    This command Exhibits similar behaviour to -add except that if a resource
    in$source exists in $targetFile the resource will be overwritten and the
    operation will continue (not fail)

-modify
  Similar to -addoverwrite, except if a resource in$source does not exist in
  $targetFile the resource will not be inserted. Can only be used when$source
  is a readable resource$source (e.g. PE, NE, RES, or RC).

-extract
  Extracts the resource(s) specified by $resourceName from $targetFile and
  saves them to $destination.
    
        If $resourceName is not in the form "Type,Name,Lang" then $destination
        must be a RES or RC file or empty. NE or PE files are not supported.
        
        If $destination is empty and $resourceName is not in the form
        "Type,Name,Lang" then the resources will be saved to a new directory
        under the current working directory in the form
        "$targetFile\Type\Name\Lang" where Lang is the filename.
        
        If $destination is empty and $resourceName refers to a specific
        resource (i.e. has Lang specified) then the file will be saved in the
        current working directory with a name in the form "Type-Name-Lang" with
        an appropriate extension

-delete
  Deletes all resources from $targetFile that match $resourceName
  Use this command with care.
  
-script
  The program will execute commands located in the specified $scriptFile.
  
  Script files must be the same format as Resource Hacker scripts, their format
  is repeated below

No examples yet, I'm too tried. Writing this Usage document took me 1.5 hours
